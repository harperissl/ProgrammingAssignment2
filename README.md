# Peer graded assignment acquisition and cleaning data course project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, use, and clean datasets.

Audit standards
The submitted dataset is neat.
The Github repository contains the required scripts.
GitHub contains a codebook that can be modified and updated with data to indicate all variables and summaries of calculations, units, and any other relevant information.
The readme file explaining the analysis files is clear and easy to understand.
The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.

Obtaining and Cleaning Data Course Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, use, and clean datasets. The goal is to prepare clean data that can be used for later analysis. Your colleagues will rate you based on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will need to submit: 1) a clean dataset as described below, 2) a link to the Github repository containing the scripts used to perform the analysis, and 3) a codebook describing the variables, data, and any transformations you created for the cleanup named CodeBook. md data. You should also include README.md in the script's repository. This repository explains how all the scripts work and how they are connected.

One of the most exciting areas in data science right now is wearable computing - see this article for example. Companies like Fitbit, Nike and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to the course website represents data collected from the accelerometer of a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description can be found on the website where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

You should create an R script called run_analysis.R to do the following.

Merge the training and test sets to create a data set.
Extract only the measurements with the mean and standard deviation of each measurement.
Use descriptive activity names to name activities in your dataset
Use descriptive variable names to label data sets appropriately.
From the data set in step 4, create a second independent, clean data set containing the means for each variable for each activity and each subject.

-------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------
Please download or copy the contents of the run_analysis.R file to the local project folder
Open the file using RStudio and click the run icon (or use the source command in the console to run the script)
After running, the file FinalData.txt will be generated in the project folder.
It contains the output data required for the job
